# Smart_Irrigation_System
IoT-based system that can efficiently control the irrigation of plants  by monitoring the soil moisture level.



This project aims to develop an IoT-based system that can efficiently control the irrigation of plants by monitoring the soil moisture level. The system uses a soil moisture sensor to measure the 
moisture level of the soil and a dual-channel relay to control the water pump. The data from the sensor is sent to a NodeMCU microcontroller, which is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi. The 
microcontroller processes the data and sends it to a cloud server, where it can be accessed by the user through a mobile application or web interface. The user can remotely control the water pump and set the desired moisture level for the soil. The system also includes an LCD screen that displays the current moisture level and the status of the water pump.The system was successfully implemented and tested in a greenhouse environment, where it demonstrated the ability to efficiently control the irrigation process and maintain the desired moisture level for the plants. The system has the potential to be further improved by adding additional features such as temperature and humidity sensors, which could enhance the accuracy of the system and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the environmental conditions in the greenhouse.
